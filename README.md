# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview:

The purpose of this analysis was to discover trends in fares by city type in the PyBer ride history data.

## Results:

Drivers in Rural areas seem to make more money per ride as there fewer other drivers to compete with (and also probably due to longer distances travelled). However, they do not create as much revenue as there are just not enough rides to make the same amount as areas with larger population density.
